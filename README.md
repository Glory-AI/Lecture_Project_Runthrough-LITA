# Lecture_Project_Runthrough-LITA

This documentation is for a project reviewed from start to finish during one of the lectures on data analysis with PowerBI.

### PROCESS

- The data (HR Data) was first imported from excel using the (Get Data) on PowerBI desktop ribbon tabs, and loaded into te transform state.
- In the transform state, the data was previewed , cleaned and checked for column quality, distribution and profile.
  Particularly, I used first rows as headers, removed unnnecessary columns, checked the data types of each column and added a new column following neccesity.
   I explored different types of DAX functions:
    * Conditional column
    * Measure
    * Calaculated Column

- Then, I clicked on 'Close & Apply' button to move the cleaned data to the report view of Power BI.
- The report view page is where visualizations are made; so I went to the insert tab and dragged a card from there to the canvas.
- After which I dragged the desired data column to be visualized to the card. The image below is a display of the output.
